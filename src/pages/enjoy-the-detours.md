I started watching the anime Hunter x Hunter for entertainment and motivation. I was bored and I realized a while back that anime motivates me to work out. However, the series turned out to be much more than a form of entertainment and motivation.

.

> It became a guide to how I'm going to live for the rest of my life.

.

The series is 148 episodes long. It’s about a 12 year old boy named Gon searching for his father, Ging, who left to become a hunter — an esteemed career in which you risk your life to hunt for treasure, mystical creatures, evil and so forth. To find his father, Gon becomes a hunter himself and after several crazy adventures, finds Ging and finally talks to him in the last episode.

.

Though, the series taught me many lessons, the advice Ging gave to Gon will stay with me forever.

.

> You should enjoy the little detours. To the fullest. Because that’s where you’ll find the things more important than what you want.

.

At first, I thought it sounded really damn cool, but eventually I started to really think about it.

.

Gon’s goal was to find his father, but from the detours he encountered on his journey he gained much more. He found friends, gained strength, suffered and well technically saved the world!

.

Though focusing on the end goal is extremely important, enjoying the detours is only going to benefit you more. I’ve always been the type of guy that wants to get shit done quickly causing me to dislike when things don’t go my way. That’s just who I am, but it’s not who I’d like to become.

.

Recently while trying to walk home, I ended up walking a good 15 minutes in the wrong direction till I realized my mistake and headed back. At the time, I was angry at myself for making a stupid mistake and wasting time, but I have a different approach to it now. This mistake causing me to make a little detour gave me something more than getting home on time would. It taught me navigation skills, time management skills and let me discover new places around the neighborhood — things I wouldn’t have had the chance to do if I hadn’t made the mistake.

.

I may not live in a world full of amazing hunters and I haven’t saved the world (yet), but Ging’s words still inspired me.

.

What I’m trying to say is, though I’ve never lived by the words of Ging before, I plan to start and encourage you to try it as well!
